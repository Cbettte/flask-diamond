Project Initialization and Scaffolding
======================================

The quickest way to start a new Flask-Diamond project is to use the scaffolding system.  This will apply a series of file templates that result in a starter application that can be further customized.

As described in the :doc:`../introduction/quick_start`, the basic process looks like this:

::

    mkvirtualenv my-diamond-app
    pip install Flask-Diamond

::

    mkdir my-diamond-app
    cd my-diamond-app
    diamond-scaffold.sh

This document will discuss the detailed configuration questions that are used during scaffolding.
