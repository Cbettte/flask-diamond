description.short = flask-diamond provides a path that can guide your thought and development; flask-diamond is the road that leads to other ideas.
description.long = flask-diamond is a python Flask application platform that roughly approximates a django.  flask-diamond imports many other Flask libraries, and then glues them all together with sensible defaults.  The end result is a model administration view, accounts and high-level account operations (e.g. password reset), testing, documentation, project management (e.g. deployment), and more.
