Learn Flask-Diamond
===================

The best way to learn Flask-Diamond is to read the :ref:`developer-guide`; contained within is a growing list of documents that explain various aspects of the Flask-Diamond approach.  To help new learners focus on the fundamentals, read the following documents first.

- :doc:`quick_start` shows you how to scaffold a new application.  You can be up and running in just a few minutes.
- :doc:`../basics/project_initialization_and_scaffolding` offers many options for you to customize your application.  Read this document to learn more about answering the questions during scaffolding.
- :doc:`../developer/model_view_controller_with_flask-diamond` describes the architecture provided by Flask-Diamond.  Model-View-Controller (MVC) is widely used in software engineering to write applications that provide a user interface.  Once you understand how to implement MVC using Flask-Diamond, you will be able to write applications for a wide range of domains.
- :doc:`../basics/writing_an_application_with_flask-diamond` provides examples and describes an approach for designing and programming something that achieves your goals.

.. - :doc:`../about/philosophy` describes some of the higher-level objectives of Flask-Diamond, which influenced the way it was designed.

.. - :doc:`../documentation/configuration_explanation` describes the configuration file, what the settings mean, and how you can change the settings based on how you want to install your application.

Learning Python
---------------

If you are relatively new to Python, you may find that there are advanced computer science principles that Flask-Diamond requires some knowledge of.  In particular, Flask-Diamond applications are heavily `Object Oriented <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html>`_ and make extensive use of `Inheritance <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance>`_.

There are many tutorials online that can help you to learn about these fundamentals.  In particular, I recommend the following:

- `Dive Into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html>`_
- `Learn Python the Hard Way <http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/>`_
